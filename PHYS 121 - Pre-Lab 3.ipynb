    "These last few examples emphasize the idea that vector fields often have associated scalar fields, and vice versa.  In many cases it is possible to calculate a vector field from the derivatives of a scalar field.  For example, for a topographic map, $dh/dx$ describes the rate of change of the height in the $x$ direction and, likewise, $dh/dy$ describes the rate of change of the height in the $y$ direction.  In other words, $dh/dx$ and $dh/dy$ characterize the steepness of the terrain.  The steepness, on its own, would represent a scalar field.  However, if we construct the vector\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{s} = \\frac{dh}{dx}\\,\\hat\\imath + \\frac{dh}{dy}\\,\\hat\\jmath $$\n",
    "it tells us the direction of steepest ascent.  Since it has a direction, quantity $\\mathbf{s}$, constructed from the derivatives of the height $h$, is an example of a vector field. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, from the topographic map of Fig. 4, we can generate a vector field that characterizes the steepest ascent at each point:\n",

    "We can do this by calculating the quantities $dh/dx$ and $dh/dy$ which tells us how quickly $h$ changes in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.  If, at a particular point in space, $dh/dx$ is large and $dh/hy$ is small, then the hill is steep in the $x$ direction and shallow in the $y$-direction.
